    <h2>1‑Sentence Answer – the punch line.</h2>
    <p>Diversifying into clean energy aligns well with your goals, supported by strong policy momentum and capital
        flows, but requires phased allocation to manage regulatory and infrastructure uncertainties.</p>
    <h2>Portfolio Impact Analysis</h2>
    <p>Your portfolio is currently concentrated 100% in US retail equities (Walmart, Best Buy) with a small hedge via
        Walmart call options—no exposure to energy or clean energy sectors. Recent news highlights extensive public and
        private investments in US and global clean energy infrastructure, policy risks around federal incentives, and
        emerging regional opportunities. This signals a strategic pivot from your retail-heavy, non-energy exposure
        toward a diversified renewable energy portfolio could capture growth potential and enhance sector
        diversification. However, political risks (federal budget pressures) and infrastructure bottlenecks pose
        near-term headwinds, while large-scale projects like Empire Wind progress affirm long-term viability.</p>
    <h2>Recommendations (Numbered)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Initiate clean energy ETF exposure at 10% portfolio weight (3-6 months)</strong> – Gain diversified
            access to US renewable companies; mitigates stock-specific execution risk and aligns with short-term pivot.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reduce retail stock holdings by 15% (3-6 months)</strong> – Rebalance capital to facilitate clean
            energy allocation and lower sector concentration risk. </li>
        <li><strong>Add selective US clean energy stocks (5-10% over 12 months)</strong> – Target sub-sectors like grid
            modernization (e.g., Avangrid), offshore wind, and battery storage to capture innovation and policy support.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Monitor federal policy developments closely (ongoing)</strong> – Adjust positions if key tax credit
            legislation is rolled back to reduce downside risk. </li>
        <li><strong>Consider infrastructure or private equity green funds (medium term, 12-24 months)</strong> – For
            long-term growth and lower volatility, participate in projects backed by multilateral and private capital
            (e.g., Stonepeak partners). </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Key Risks &amp; Unknowns</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potential rollback of US clean energy tax incentives could delay or depress sector growth. </li>
        <li>Grid infrastructure constraints may slow renewable energy adoption and project returns. </li>
        <li>Regulatory uncertainty in emerging markets and evolving geopolitical risks. </li>
        <li>Exposure to disruptive technologies within clean energy sub-sectors may increase volatility. </li>
        <li>Illiquidity and higher capital requirements for private energy infrastructure funds. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Confidence (0‑100%)</h2>
    <p>75% — Strong fundamental drivers and robust investments support the clean energy shift, tempered by federal
        policy risk and infrastructure challenges that require active management.</p>
    <h2>References &amp; Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Assumes stable or moderately supportive US policy environment; Inflation Reduction Act credits remain
            largely intact. </li>
        <li>Investment flows into grid modernization (Avangrid) and large projects (Empire Wind) signal growing
            opportunities. </li>
        <li>Portfolio currently concentrated in retail, creating both sector concentration risk and room for
            diversification. </li>
        <li>Global investment trends favor clean energy with substantial public-private partnerships evident in recent
            deals. </li>
