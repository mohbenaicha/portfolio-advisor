        "Link": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/05/45357529/why-shopify-shop-stock-hit-a-new-52-week-high-today",
        "summary": "Shopify Inc SHOP shares jumped 14.8% to $105.26 Monday afternoon. It was earlier announced the stock will join the Nasdaq-100 beginning May 19, replacing MongoDB. The move positions Shopify among the market's top tech names and could attract index-fund inflows.\n\nWhat Else: The e-commerce platform reported strong first-quarter results last Thursday, with revenue climbing 26.8% year-over-year to $2.36 billion, beating estimates. \n\nGross merchandise volume rose 22.8% to $74.75 billion, though adjusted EPS of 25 cents narrowly missed forecasts. Analysts cited robust growth in global merchant activity and resilient consumer demand as key drivers.\n\nSentiment also improved as the U.S. and China reached a landmark agreement to slash tariffs, easing recession and inflation fears. With U.S. tariffs dropping from 145% to 30% and China's from 125% to 10%, global trade pressures are receding. \n\nShopify noted minimal exposure to Chinese imports, suggesting limited direct impact from prior tariff risks. Analysts from Goldman Sachs and Piper Sandler expect continued growth into the second-quarter, with revenue forecast around $2.56 billion and EPS of 30 cents. Shopify's international momentum meanwhile remains a key pillar of its bullish outlook.\n\nRead Also: New Inflation Data Hits Tuesday: Why It Could Kill Fed Rate Cut Hopes\n\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Shopify – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\n\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy “fractional shares,” which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.\n\nIn the case of Shopify, which is trading at $104.42 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 0.96 shares of stock.\n\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to “go short” a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource.  Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\n\nAccording to data from Benzinga Pro, SHOP has a 52-week high of $106.35 and a 52-week low of $69.84."

        "summary": "Nu Holdings Ltd. (NU Quick QuoteNU  -  Free Report)     will report first-quarter 2025 results on May 13, after market close.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is $3.5 billion, indicating 27.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for total earnings is pinned at 12 cents per share, suggesting a 33.3% jump from the year-ago quarter's actual. There has been no change in analyst estimates or revisions lately.\n\nNU has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the four trailing quarters, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average surprise of 10%.\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NU this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nNU has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe consensus estimate for interest income and gains is pegged at $2.9 billion, suggesting an increase of 29.8% from the year-ago quarter’s actual. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee and commission income is pegged at $529.4 million, indicating a 16.2% year-over-year rise.\n\nFor active customers, the consensus mark is pinned at 97.6 million, implying an 18.1% increase from the year-ago quarter’s actual. NU’s customer-centric approach across Brazil, Mexico and Colombia is likely to have led to more customer wins.\n\nNu Holdings' shares have gained 23.8% in the year-to-date period outperforming the 16.1% rise of its industry and the 4.4% fall of the Zacks S&P 500 composite. The company has performed better than its industry peers, Bank Of Montreal (BMO Quick QuoteBMO  -  Free Report)     and Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS Quick QuoteBNS  -  Free Report)    . BMO has gained 2.6% while BNS has declined 6.5% for the same period.\n\nThe NU stock is looking pricier than the Bank of Montreal, the Bank of Nova Scotia, and the industry as a whole. NU is currently trading at a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 20.51X, higher than the industry’s 9.08X. Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia have price-to-earnings ratios of 11.58X and 9.77X, respectively.\n\nNU’s digital-first and scalable business model reduces operational costs, thereby, boosting efficiency. This strategy has positioned the company as a prominent player within traditional banking. It has not only improved financial inclusion but also enhanced accessibility across markets. Nu Holdings has captured a fair share of Brazil’s traditional banking market on the back of its cost-effective structure and customer-centric model.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, NU witnessed a 22% year-over-year jump in active customers. This impressive growth can be attributed to the company’s digital-first strategy. Furthermore, the company is expanding its operations in Latin America, mainly in Mexico and Colombia, where adoption is on the rise. Nu Holdings is poised to grow further by tapping into uncharted territories.\n\nThe company’s long-term vision involves a global AI-driven digital banking model by which it can provide hundreds of millions of customers with access to financial products and services that have historically been reserved for a few. We expect this strategy to drive in customers, boosting its customer base, leading to an increase in its top line.\n\nNU’s diversified revenue model enables it to mitigate risks and provides stability in economic uncertainties. Higher monetization of its platform and increased user engagement improved its top line in the fourth quarter of 2024, evidenced by 24.3% year-over-year growth.\n\nMeanwhile, one should keep in mind that the company operates in a fiercely competitive market and is still far from capturing a significant portion of the market. This can certainly compel NU to invest more in technology and talent to stay ahead in the game. While the company may reap benefits in the long run, the difficulty in balancing growth and profitability may increase.\n\nNu Holdings' long-term growth strategy involves acquiring more customers utilizing its digital-first strategy and AI-led practices. The top line is expected to improve as the company expands into untapped markets. However, in a highly competitive environment, NU may be required to make large investments to capture a fair share of the market. This can certainly affect its ability to balance growth and profitability.\n\nNU, despite being a fundamentally strong stock, has a premium valuation. Hence, a cautious approach should be taken by investors. We recommend investors hold on to the stock for now and wait for a better entry point that can emerge if the stock undergoes some correction."

This compares to earnings of $0.05 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -25%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.30, delivering a surprise of 233.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\n\nSelectQuote, which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, posted revenues of $408.16 million for the quarter ended March 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.12%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $376.4 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nSelectQuote shares have lost about 28.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -3.8%.\n\nWhile SelectQuote has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for SelectQuote: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.14 on $340 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.07 on $1.53 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Multi line is currently in the top 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nFidelis Insurance Holdings (FIHL Quick QuoteFIHL  -  Free Report)    , another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2025. The results are expected to be released on May 14.\n\nThis insurance and reinsurance company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -158.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFidelis Insurance Holdings' revenues are expected to be $656.08 million, up 26.2% from the year-ago quarter."

The combined ratio of 115% deteriorated 400 basis points (bps) year over year.

Specifically, Defendants: (1) misrepresented the capabilities of the Company's risk-based pricing models; (2) issued materially misleading statements regarding the Company's profit share revenue; (3) failed to disclose the Company's 2021 and 2022 vintage loans had become worth significantly less than their corresponding outstanding loan balances; and (4) misrepresented the underperformance of the Company's 2023 and 2024 vintage loans.

        "summary": "New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - May 10, 2025) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of The Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: TBBK) between January 25, 2024 and March 4, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important May 16, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Bancorp securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. \n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Bancorp class action, go to  https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=37146 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 16, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Bancorp had underrepresented the significant risk of default or loss on its real estate bridge loan (\"REBL\") portfolio; (2) Bancorp's current expected credit loss methodology was insufficient to account for the provision and/or allowance of credit losses; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Bancorp was reasonably likely to increase its provision for credit losses; (4) there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting; (5) its financial statements had not been approved by its independent auditor; (6) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about Bancorp's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\t\t\n\nTo join the Bancorp class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=37146 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm. \n\nAttorney Advertising.

From Steve Jobs‘ resurfaced interview about the importance of hiring top-notch software engineers, to changes in iPhone release strategy, and a privacy lawsuit settlement, the tech giant was in the headlines throughout the week. Here’s a recap of the top stories.\n\nSteve Jobs on the Importance of Hiring A-Players\n\nIn a 1995 interview that recently resurfaced, the late Jobs, then chief of NeXT Computer, emphasized the significance of hiring only the best software engineers. Jobs stated that the difference between good and great software engineers is a staggering 50-to-1. He admitted that letting go of non-performers was a painful but necessary process. \n\nApple is reportedly planning a significant shift in its iPhone release strategy starting with the iPhone 18 series in 2026. According to unnamed supply chain sources, high-end models like the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will be released in the fall, followed by more affordable models in the spring of 2027. \n\nSee Also: Apple Warns Of ‘Hundreds Of Millions To Billions’ Dollar Losses Over Epic Games Ruling, Seeks Stay Amid App Store Shakeup\n\nApple’s $95 Million Privacy Lawsuit Settlement\n\nApple users who believe Siri may have secretly recorded private conversations now have a chance to get compensated. Eligible consumers have started receiving emails titled “Lopez Voice Assistant Class Action Settlement,” informing them that they may be entitled to part of the settlement. \n\nTony Fadell, the inventor of the iPod, compared Apple’s hard-edged work culture with Google’s plush perks. He stated that at Apple, you couldn’t hide, and everyone was critical, whereas Google’s perks could smother urgency and innovation.

(Nasdaq, NYSE Texas: DJT) (\"Trump Media\" or the \"Company\"), operator of the social media platform Truth Social, the streaming platform Truth+, and the FinTech brand Truth.Fi, is announcing financial results for the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2025, and is filing its 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") today.\n\nIn the first quarter Trump Media maintained a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $759.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The Company believes this amount of liquidity, in conjunction with Trump Media’s low operating costs and low cash burn rate, will fully enable it to pursue all its expansion plans, including enhancing its existing platforms, diversifying into fintech and financial services, and pursuing potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\nIn the first quarter, Trump Media pursued its mission with the following actions:\n\nTrump Media also recently obtained shareholder approval for the Company’s reincorporation in Florida, which became effective on April 30.\n\nDescribed in Trump Media’s recent letter to shareholders, the Company’s ambitious growth strategy envisions expanding all its current operations and moving into new realms, with Trump Media eventually evolving into a holding company for prime assets spanning numerous industries. The Company’s plans include:\n\nTrump Media Chairman and CEO Devin Nunes said, “As we launched our diversification strategy last quarter, we developed unique financial products to meet the demand for non-woke funds that invest in superior American companies. We anticipate that this offering will just be the initial step in a wider expansion into new realms and industries, which will occur as we enhance both Truth Social and Truth+, including our plan to introduce a Truth+ subscription package with premium content. We are now taking every possible step to position the Company to expand robustly throughout the America-First economy.”\n\nThe Company had a low operating cash outflow of $9.7 million including combined interest income and revenues of $8.8 million for the quarter. Trump Media incurred $10.9 million in legal fees, including costs related to the Company's March 2024 merger with a special purpose acquisition company—one of the longest SPAC mergers in history. The fees include those incurred in litigation aiming to recoup merger-related damages from those individuals and entities that the Company alleges caused the delay of the SPAC through their wrongful acts, as well as expenses related to the Company’s reincorporation from Delaware to Florida. Additionally, Trump Media had net losses including $19.6 million in non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, resulting in a GAAP net loss of $31.7 million and a GAAP operating loss of $39.5 million.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Company continued to focus on building out its ecosystem, improving its existing platforms, and diversifying into financial services. Trump Media believes its robust and uncancellable infrastructure, expanding range of services, and strong balance sheet that includes $759.0 million of cash and investments strongly positions the Company to begin implementing monetization plans on its platforms, fully launch Truth.Fi financial products, and continue pursuing new assets and/or partnerships, including via potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\nCautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the plans, strategies, and prospects, both business and financial, of Trump Media. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, including potential merger & acquisition activity, the rollout of products and features, the future plans, timing and potential success of the streaming services and the launch and success of our financial services and FinTech platform. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or realize these plans, intentions, or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, or results of operations, are forward-looking statements.

There may be events in the future that we are not accurately able to predict, or over which we have no control.\n\nThe mission of Trump Media is to end Big Tech's assault on free speech by opening up the Internet and giving people their voices back. Trump Media operates Truth Social, a social media platform established as a safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations, as well as Truth+, a TV streaming platform focusing on family-friendly live TV channels and on-demand content. Trump Media is also launching Truth.Fi, a financial services and FinTech brand incorporating America First investment vehicles.\n\nShannon Devine (MZ Group | Managing Director - MZ North America)Email: shannon.devine@mzgroup.us"

The company’s quarterly revenue growth of 26.8% to $2.36 billion beat the analyst consensus estimate of $2.33 billion. \n\nThe e-commerce platform company reported adjusted EPS of $0.25, up 25% but missed the analyst consensus estimate of $0.26.\n\nAlso Read: Shopify Q1 Likely Solid, But Analyst Says Tariff Commentary And Q2 Outlook Will Steer Investor Focus\n\nGross merchandise volume increased 22.8% to $74.75 billion. Merchant solutions revenue increased 28.9% to $1.74 billion. \n\nWall Street analysts rerated the stock after the report.\n\nPiper Sandler: GMV grew 23%, driven by same-store sales growth for existing customers and growth in merchants globally. Management noted that only 1% of overall GMV is related to imports from China, subject to the de minimis exemption, Jeffries said.\n\nThe second-quarter guidance factors in continued strength in GMV data through April and May, translating to mid-20s revenue growth and high-teens gross profit growth. Guiding to mid-20s revenue growth but expecting to see high-teens gross profit growth will likely be the primary nitpick for investors, the analyst stated.\n\nFree cash flow margins will likely be again in the mid-teens range. Jeffries will closely monitor this into next quarter, as he noted a decline in free cash flow margins would be a negative event for the stock.\n\nShopify is successfully benefiting from the globalization of commerce through digital technology, and the scale advantages built in the North American market translate to substantial market share gains abroad. International is the linchpin to believing Shopify can continue to grow at ~20% over the medium term and is crucial for the bull story.\n\nJeffries projected second-quarter revenue of $2.56 billion and EPS of $0.30.\n\nGoldman Sachs: Shopify’s GMV multiplier as a percentage of U.S. eCommerce growth remains strong, indicating continued market share gains that will likely expand further in periods of volatility even as U.S. eCommerce growth slows. Shopify continues progressing in the enterprise, which Borges expects to be a key growth driver in 2025.\n\nShopify’s data has shown little evidence of a slowdown, with strength in April and early May. When asked about Flexport’s view of disruption, Shopify noted that it has not seen similar trends and that its merchant bases have different characteristics.\n\nWhile management acknowledged continued uncertainty and noted that the full impact of the current trade environment remains to be seen, they shared some metrics to help investors understand Shopify’s exposures.\n\nCross-border continues to make up 15% of GMV, with half of this number representing U.S. trade, which is split between inbound and outbound. 1% of the overall GMV is from China and is subject to the de minimis exemption.\n\nWhile Shopify has seen some merchants raise prices, they have not seen broad pricing increases and noted that their typical consumer is more resilient to pricing increases, the analyst said.\n\nShopify believes its merchant base is exposed to verticals that are more able to adapt, with limited exposure to verticals like electronics and higher exposure to verticals like fashion, apparel, and beauty. Management is skeptical that tariffs have pulled forward demand, noting that China’s production capacity limits the degree to which it can flex upwards, Borges noted.\n\nPressure on gross margins in 2025 is due to the PayPal partnership, payments increasing as a % of the business, noncash revenue rolling off, enterprise traction, and the impact from longer paid trial lengths causing pressure on subscription revenue growth. While Merchant Solutions’ gross margin will continue to be pressured by payments, Payment adoption can help increase the adoption of many of Shopify’s newer margin-accretive products, which should help margins stabilize over time.\n\nWhile free cash flow margins will likely trend sideways in 2025, the analyst noted the potential for structurally higher terminal margins due to Shopify’s vertical software competitive moat.\n\nSHOP Price Action: Shopify stock is down 2.93% at $91.25 at the last check on Friday."

The outlook implies sequential revenue growth of 3%-5%, which reflects seasonality and resource constraints in onboarding new advertisers until the self-serve platform opens up.\n\nCarpenter projected second-quarter revenue of $1.22 billion and EPS of $2.01.\n\nGoldman Sachs: AppLovin management emphasized key themes in its first-quarter earnings report.

Over half of the sequential growth came from gaming advertisers, from which he noted that e-commerce grew to $180 million (ahead of Dessouky’s estimate of $150 million), up from $100 million in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe pace of web merchant onboarding slowed compared to December because AppLovin’s e-commerce team remains small and must manage the advertisers who have already been onboarded while onboarding new advertisers.\n\nDemand remains overwhelmingly strong, and the rollout of its self-service dashboard this quarter will re-accelerate onboarding, likely beyond 100 incremental monthly advertisers.\n\nManagement sounded somewhat cautious on second-quarter 2025 guidance (advertising segment +5% Q/Q), citing the temporary slowdown in web merchant onboarding; guidance does not assume a meaningful increase in e-commerce net revenue.\n\nNonetheless, he modeled 11% sequentially because AI model enhancements in the quarter could result in step change performance and results ahead of his model. Moreover, second-quarter e-commerce industry sales benefit from ~5% seasonality.\n\nDessouky projected second-quarter revenue of $1.60 billion and EPS of $2.34.\n\nPrice Action: APP stock is down 2.73% to $331.84 at the last check on Friday."

        "Link": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2465981/mgic-investment-corporation-mtg-hit-a-52-week-high-can-the-run-continue",
        "summary": "Have you been paying attention to shares of MGIC Investment (MTG Quick QuoteMTG  -  Free Report)    ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 13.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $26.59 in the previous session. MGIC Investment has gained 10.7% since the start of the year compared to the 2.5% move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 2.8% return for the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry.\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 30, 2025, MGIC reported EPS of $0.75 versus consensus estimate of $0.66.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, MGIC is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share on $1.25 billion in revenues. This represents a -4.12% change in EPS on a 2.91% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.96 per share on $1.29 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 5.97% and 2.92%, respectively.\n\nMGIC may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nMGIC has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 9.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 9.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 8.5X versus its peer group's average of 10.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.51. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, MGIC currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if MGIC fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though MGIC shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nShares of MTG have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is EverQuote, Inc. (EVER Quick QuoteEVER  -  Free Report)    . EVER has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of A.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. EverQuote, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 18.75%, and for the current fiscal year, EVER is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share on revenue of $640.31 million.\n\nShares of EverQuote, Inc. have gained 9.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 19.77X and a P/CF of 21.79X.\n\nThe Insurance - Multi line industry is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MTG and EVER, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation."

        "summary": "Billionaire investor and Shark Tank fame Mark Cuban criticized the growing popularity of memecoins and said that it undermines the “value and utility” of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat Happened: When asked about President Donald Trump‘s support for cryptocurrency and memecoins, Cuban told the Block that “Memecoins and gaming TVL sets a bad example to people who want to try to understand the utility and value of crypto.”\n\nTrump has been personally involved in promoting assets like memecoins via his sons’ ventures and also via Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.’s DJT foray into the space.\n\nThe President owns DJT through a trust. Specifically, he transferred his shares in the company to a trust controlled by his son, Donald Trump Jr., to mitigate potential conflicts of interest ahead of his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nHowever, Cuban was supportive of Trump’s efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies at large. “I’m glad to see what he has done from a regulatory perspective,” he said, adding, “I’m thrilled to see changes at the SEC. They are long overdue.”\n\nSee Also: Tinder Parent Match Group Cuts 13% Of Workforce After Earnings Miss, Taps Gen Z Features Like ‘Double Date’ To Spark Growth\n\nDisclosure: 82% of retail CFD accounts lose money\n\nWhy It Matters: A Trump-owned business entity holds a 60% stake in World Liberty and receives 75% of all coin sale revenue. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are involved in management, while Zachary Folkman, Chase Herro, and Zach Witkoff handle daily operations.  \n\nThis Trump family-backed platform launched its stablecoin $TRUMP TRUMP/USD in January alongside other digital currencies. The coin has surged 1082.11% since it began trading on Jan. 18.\n\nAs of the publication of this article, it was 18.91% at $14.44 per coin.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ, which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, respectively, were slightly higher in premarket on Friday.

        "Link": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2465852/essent-group-esnt-tops-q1-earnings-and-revenue-estimates",
        "summary": "Essent Group (ESNT Quick QuoteESNT  -  Free Report)     came out with quarterly earnings of $1.69 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.70 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.81%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this mortgage insurance and reinsurance holding company would post earnings of $1.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.58, delivering a surprise of -5.39%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nEssent Group, which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, posted revenues of $317.56 million for the quarter ended March 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.03%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $298.36 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nEssent Group shares have added about 7.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -3.7%.\n\nWhile Essent Group has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Essent Group: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.70 on $314.81 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.85 on $1.27 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Property and Casualty is currently in the top 17% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWhiteHorse Finance (WHF Quick QuoteWHF  -  Free Report)    , another stock in the broader Zacks Finance sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2025. The results are expected to be released on May 12.\n\nThis lender to small companies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nWhiteHorse Finance's revenues are expected to be $20.02 million, down 21.4% from the year-ago quarter."

        "summary": "Bitcoin surged past the $102,000-mark for the first time since January, buoyed by growing optimism around U.S. trade negotiations, Coinbase’s (COIN Quick QuoteCOIN  -  Free Report)     Deribit Acquisition, and soaring institutional interest. Bitcoin is up over 7% for the week as Trump pushed for trade deals.\n\nBitcoin-based exchange-trade funds (ETFs) like Wisdomtree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW Quick QuoteBTCW  -  Free Report)    , Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR Quick QuoteBRRR  -  Free Report)    , Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC Quick QuoteFBTC  -  Free Report)    , iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT Quick QuoteIBIT  -  Free Report)    , Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC Quick QuoteGBTC  -  Free Report)     and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO Quick QuoteBTCO  -  Free Report)     have been hovering around a three-month high.\n\nPresident Trump's announcement of a new trade agreement with the UK and his upbeat comments on future negotiations with China spread cheers around the investing world and the risk-on sentiments.\n\nTrump introduced a new US-UK trade deal on Thursday, describing it as a major step toward increased market access, worth billions of dollars, for American products, especially in agriculture. The agreement includes expanded opportunities for U.S. exports of beef, ethanol and other farm goods.\n\nSecretary Bessent stated that the upcoming discussions would focus on de-escalating tensions. The news was enough to boost market sentiment across risk assets, including Bitcoin.\n\nBoosting optimism further, Coinbase (COIN Quick QuoteCOIN  -  Free Report)     announced its $2.9 billion acquisition of crypto options exchange Deribit. The deal was viewed as a vote of confidence in the crypto sector and helped push Bitcoin higher.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase came up with quarterly earnings of $1.94 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85. The company posted revenues of $2.03 billion in the quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.12%. \n\nBitcoin had previously dropped to $75,000 following Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, which shocked markets. However, the asset has rebounded sharply as risk-on sentiment improved and equity markets stabilized.\n\nStandard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick, who previously forecast Bitcoin hitting $120,000 in Q2, now says that target might be too low, citing a surge in institutional inflows and capital reallocation away from U.S. assets, as quoted on CNBC.\n\nKendrick noted the evolving narrative around Bitcoin. Once linked to risky assets and later seen as a strategic hedge, Bitcoin is now primarily driven by the sheer volume of inflows. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs alone have seen $5.3 billion in inflows over the last three weeks.\n\nKendrick reaffirmed his longer-term target of $200,000 by year-end 2025, driven by asset diversification and continued accumulation by “whales.”\n\nInstitutional interest continues to support Bitcoin’s rally. Kendrick pointed to prominent institutions entering the space, including MicroStrategy’s (MSTR Quick QuoteMSTR  -  Free Report)     continued Bitcoin accumulation, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund investing in iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT Quick QuoteIBIT  -  Free Report)    , and the Swiss National Bank purchasing MicroStrategy shares.\n\nWith MicroStrategy often viewed as a proxy for Bitcoin, these moves signal deepening institutional conviction. MSTR shares rose 5.6% on May 8, 2025. Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF (MSTX Quick QuoteMSTX  -  Free Report)     surged 11.5% on May 8 and hit a three-month high.\n\nBernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani reported that roughly 80 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets — collectively owning about 3.4% of total BTC supply. He highlighted this as a sign of growing long-term support from corporate treasuries, as quoted on Yahoo Finance."

        "summary": "On Wednesday, Arm Holdings Plc ARM chose not to provide full-year fiscal 2026 guidance, with its chief financial officer citing unpredictable market signals, partner caution, and potential macroeconomic disruptions as key reasons.\n\nWhat Happened: Speaking on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, Arm CFO Jason Child addressed why the semiconductor design giant opted to withhold fiscal 2026 guidance — a departure from its usual practice.\n\nChild explained that while Arm typically offers annual forecasts with a reasonable range to cover expected deal timing, this year's market environment presented unusually murky signals, particularly from partners and customers.\n\n\"Almost none of them are providing full-year guidance,\" Child said. \"The amount of signal I'm getting from partners, whether it's through guidance or from other reporting, is just less than I've had in the past.\"\n\nThe CFO also pointed to the broader macroeconomic risks, especially tariff-related uncertainties, which add another layer of unpredictability. \"If I provide a range, I'd have to give you an even wider range than I had last year,\" he stated. \" I don't know if it would be that helpful.\"\n\nWhy It's Important: Arm Holdings posted quarterly earnings of 55 cents per share, surpassing analyst expectations of 52 cents. Revenue for the quarter reached $1.24 billion, exceeding the $1.23 billion consensus estimate and rising from $928 million in the same period a year ago.\n\nARM Price Action: Arm’s stock fell 11.63% to $109.75 in after-hours trading on Wednesday, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nARM Holdings PLC currently holds a consensus price target of $143.81, according to ratings from 32 analysts.
